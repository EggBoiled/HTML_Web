            <div class="grid-item"> <p>Welcome to my very first ever webpage! It's a work in progress but through each updates, you'll soon see the changes that'll
              revolutionize it into a new state! <br>
          
               This is the first update to the website as i'm in the process of styling out the webpage. I still need to figure out the
              correct correlating color and placement for the pictures, besides that the bordering might need a possible. I feel like eventually 
              everything will need to be revamp into something more transitional with a smooth out experience in terms of consistency.
          
              -3 This is my second update. I'm having a hard time now trying to make things more clean and modern. It's confusing reviewing since it feels
              like you have to relearn everything from that weeek. I'm sure I can get all of this done, although late but If I can do this. I'll be able to
              gain a possible new skill that'll help me create more and better websites in the future. </div>
